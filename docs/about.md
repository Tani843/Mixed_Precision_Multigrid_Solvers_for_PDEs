# About This Project

## Motivation

The solution of large-scale partial differential equations (PDEs) is fundamental to numerous scientific and engineering applications, from climate modeling to computational fluid dynamics. Traditional approaches face significant challenges:

### Computational Challenges

- **Scale**: Modern applications require solving systems with millions or billions of unknowns
- **Performance**: Single-precision vs double-precision trade-offs affect both speed and accuracy

- **Efficiency**: Memory bandwidth limitations constrain performance on modern architectures

### Research Gap

While multigrid methods provide optimal O(N) complexity for elliptic PDEs, existing implementations often:

- Use uniform precision arithmetic, missing performance opportunities
- Lack comprehensive validation frameworks for mixed-precision approaches
- Don't fully exploit modern GPU architectures
- Provide limited analysis of precision trade-offs
